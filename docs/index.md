# The Gutshot Gamble

With what has been dubbed the "second boom" of poker, it feels like everybody has started going 'all-in'. In an effort to ensure that nobody gets left behind, our group decided 
to focus our reinforcement learning pursuit in the direction of helping our fellow students test their skills against an intensely trained poker agent. To simplify the game to 
its fundamentals, we decided to break the game down into 5 component moves: check, fold, raise quarter-pot, raise half-pot, raise full pot, but with the full 52-card standard deck.
With a mix of PPO self-play and Monte Carlo CFR techniques/policies, we've developed our agent to become the perfect whetstone for our fellow classmates to hone their poker edge.
